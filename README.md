# HP2Dt1DTEG
A 2D transient heat transfer model to predict the electrical power output of a TEG system on a car. This would model the waste heat recovery potential of a Heat Pipe assisted TEG system.

It employs Eigen, a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms. Check their website: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
